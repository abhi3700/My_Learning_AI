## Comparison with Tensorflow

| Parameters | Keras                                                  | Tensorflow                                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --- |
| Type       | High-Level                                             | API Wrapper                                                         | Low-Level | API |
| Complexity | Easy to use if you Python language                     | You need to learn the syntax of using some of Tensorflow function   |
| Purpose    | Rapid deployment for making model with standard layers | Allows you to make an arbitrary computational graph or model layers |
| Tools      | Uses other API debug tool such as TFDBG                | You can use Tensorboard visualization tools                         |
| Community  | Large active communities                               | Large active communities and widely shared resources                |
