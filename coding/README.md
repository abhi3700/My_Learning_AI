## Coding in ML
1. Linear Regression
	- The loss function is MSE of n data divided by n. `(y_pred - y_actual)`
	- This error/loss function needs to be minimized for optimal fitting of our model.
	- But, why MSE? Because, it makes big errors bigger and very small errors smaller due to the square term.
	- The summation is done over the entire dataset to calculate the error.
2. Logistic Regression
